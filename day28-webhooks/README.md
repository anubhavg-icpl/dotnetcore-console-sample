# Day 28 - Webhooks (removed)

The ASP.Net Core Web API that was previously hosted in this folder has been removed as it did not align with the other .Net Core console samples in this repository.  For an example of using change notifications / webhooks with Microsoft Graph please see the following repo: [microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-changenotifications](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-changenotifications)
