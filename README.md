# dotnetcore-console-sample

## NOTE
This repo is a work in progress and as such does not have a complete README at this time.  Once ready there will be instructions similar to the [ASP.Net Getting Started lab](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-aspnetmvcapp/blob/master/Lab.md) for registering an Azure AD application, granting permissions, etc.  For the time being do not treat this as a complete sample.  Thank you for your patience.

## Configuration

1. Rename the `appsettings.json.example` file to `appsettings.json`.
1. Edit `appsettings.json`:
    1. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID_HERE` with your application ID from the App Registration Portal.
